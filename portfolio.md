### <b><u>Dym</u></b>
<img src="http://Callmezyos.github.io/images/Dym-Gif-Pt2-OPTIMZED.gif" alt="A gif showing off the level design of Dym" style="width:500px;height:200px;vertical-align: right">

- Dym was an original concept that I came up then merged with another idea in college.
- I had the privilege of leading a small team of people from various disciplines into developing a vertical slice of the game.
- Over the course of 15 weeks we concepted the idea and built the entire verticle slice from scratch.
- I was primarily in charge of the art and design of the game. 
- Part of our preproduction process included making a GDD explaining all of the facets of the game. Since the game was never released and we were in college, the GDD is out of scope.
- Ideally, Dym was going to be Metroid-vania / Contra like with waaaaay more work on the time ability.
- Main features included: Plane switching, killable enemies, working 'slow time ability', working weapon arm, explorable environment, spline camera, and an intro!

### <b>Would you like to play a VERY ROUGH demo of Dym?</b>
- You can download the zip files from this Google Drive link: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GkCfJGKMCPzQLIG90WcN_pqUAZPg6ZiZ/view?usp=sharing">Dym Demo Package</a>
- Once you download and extract the files you can follow the 'README' contained within for more instructions.
- Also included is the intro cutscene, which did not make it into the Demo build but I still wanted to show it off <3

### <b><u>The Skull Kid</u></b>
<img src="http://Callmezyos.github.io/images/SkullKid-Optimized.gif" alt="A gif showing off the Skull Kid level" style="width:500px;height:200px;vertical-align: right">
- The Skull Kid was a college project in which a small team just a made a vertical slice of on original concept in a few weeks.
- Disciplines were split up amongst the students, who then worked collaboratively to put together a GDD and vertical slice.
- The Skull Kid takes place in the world of The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask but from the view of the Skull Kid
- For this project I was the Level Designer
- Ideally, this is where the game would start. Having players go around the village causing mayhem, resulting in the eventual theft of Majora Mask. 
- Main features included: Skull kid model, Spline camera intro,working mini-map, and multiple objectives [although the footage only depicts 1 objective] 

### <b><u>Charred Alive</u></b>
<div align="center"><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/90tvLY6"  ><a href="//imgur.com/a/90tvLY6">Charred Alive - Simulation and Serious Games Level</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
- Charred Alive was one of the first college projects I worked on (you can tell by the level design lol)
- Was designed for a Simulation and Serious games class with the intention of teaching people about fire safety
- Players started on the 2nd floor of a burning building and had to successfully and safely get out of the building in a limited amount of time, while following the fire safety procedures. 
- Ideally, there would have been a quiz before you started the level, then you would take what you learned in the quiz and apply it to the simulation.
- Main features included: Testing door knob temperature, staying low beneath the smoke, pulling alarms, and prompting players about not using the elevator.
