- Dym was an original concept that I came up then merged with another idea in college.
- I had the privilege of leading a small team of people from various disciplines into developing a vertical slice of the game.
- Over the course of 15 weeks we concepted the idea and built the entire verticle slice from scratch.
- Part of our concepting including making a GDD explaining all of the facets of the game. Its a bit of out scope, but what do you expect from college students.
