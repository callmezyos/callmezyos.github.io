title: Very Late January Update
---

Once again its been quite a long time since I checked in around here. This might be a shorter post sinced its late. 
Well if you have been paying attention the last few weeks there have been some updates to the site. Mostly they 
have just been some slight content updates to my resume since its been a couple years (according to GitHub), 
a couple more titles under the ol belt. The other bigger change was that I changed up the site background to 
something that fits and works better as a repeating background. 

One more quick life update, since like I said its been a bit. I recieved a promotion at work to now be a Senior QA 
Analyst at Jackbox Games so its definitely nice to be able to move up the ladder yet again. Especially in a time when
the game industry as a whole has seen a TON of layoffs since the start of 2024. Luckily, we have been assured that we 
are ok so thats reassuring for the moment.

Going forward, I would like to try and use this site even more. Not going to make this like an every day life blog 
or anything but keeping it gaming and game industry content related. So maybe the occassional Glog post, career 
updates, and gaming industry news. I also want to add an arcade section to the site. In which, I would upload games
or demos or vertical slices or whatever stuff im working on that people can play and mess with. Ideally, I would be
able to get some old college Unity projects working so that I could make some builds to put onto the site. 

You may be asking, why now? Previously I have had resolutions of producing more content in any way shape or form. 
Well at the time I was referring to streaming (mostly on Twitch but also dabbled in Youtube) cuz it was something 
that I had always wanted to try out. Well I definitely tried, but sadly things didnt quite take off. Thats fine.
It wasn't expected, nor was I depending on it. Anywho, after a few years of VERY slow growth it just felt like
I was putting a ton into it for something that A) wasnt getting a lot of views B) Had prolly already been done 
before by someone better. So in a sense, I wasn't creating anything new that hasn't been seen before. Gaming
content is already VERY saturated on both Twitch and Youtube anyways. Additionally, just due to how my 
day-to-day worked out, I wasn't able to get on stream until much later in the evening when most poeple in my 
timezone were getting ready for or already in bed. Combine that with also being a variety streamer and boom,
thats your recipe for incredibly slow growth. I will still prolly stream and upload stuff to Youtube but 
definitely on not as much of a consistent basis anymore. 

Anywho, stay tuned, cuz were only getting started around here.
