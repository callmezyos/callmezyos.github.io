title: Game Photography page is LIVE
---
I am pleased to announce that the 'Game Photography' page of the site is now live! 

Over the last couple years I had been taking screenshots of the games that I have
been playing through. Originally, I had been just uploading them to Imgur, Reddit,
and my Discord but I figured why not add them to the website? So now, as I play and
complete games if I take any screenshots during the playthrough, I shall post them 
here too!

I had been originally hesitant to the idea and thought about just keeping them where
they were. Keeping my personal stuff away from my professional stuff. As time went on 
tho, I discovered that the site seemed kinda plain with not much personality to it. I
have seen other peers with webiste and theres definitely have an idenity and a reason 
to go there. Mine had been just a blog with a version of my resume on it and that was 
pretty much it. Now, adding in this Game Photography page and hopefully in time an 
'Arcade' or 'Games' page or something gives the site some added flair and an extra dose 
of me which anyone looking at the site, potential employers included can get a sense of
who I am and what I'm like. 

So seems like a win-win since I want to use the site more.
