title: Missing game photography albums
---

##Quick Update
I am not sure when, or how for that matter, but it appears that Imgur has deleted 
several of the screenshot albums that I had on the site. Sadly we lost some good ones:
- Sand Land
- Ghost of Tsushima
- The Last of Us: Part 1
- Cyberpunk 2077
- Final Fantasy 7 Remake

To make matters slightly worse, I deleted a majority of the albums related to the games to save
space on my console. I have a few of my favorites saved, so I will remake the albums with 
what I can. There just wont be as many images.
