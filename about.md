Hello! My name is Alex and I am a game, simulation, and software designer originally from Wisconsin but living in Illinois 

Currently, I am a Senior Quality Assurance Analyst working on the latest and greatest from Jackbox Games. Having worked on hits such as Jackbox Party Pack 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Quiplash 2: InterLASHtional, and The Jackbox Party Starter. Additionally, I was an Associate Game Designer working on Mutant Football League for Digital Dreams Entertainment, (2015-2/18). Then from 2018 to 2019 I was a Contract Game Designer working on Madden 19 and Madden 20 at EA Sports. Lastly, from 2015 and 2016 I was a Simulation and Software Designer for ARX working on a project called Full Thottle.

I received my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Game Design with a concentration in Game Development from Columbia College Chicago in 2015. Working in this industry has given me the opportunity to develop and hone my arsenal of skills all while working along side diverse co-workers of various disciplines. My passion for creating is what drives my desire to be a part of this industry. I'm a quick learner who's always looking to jump into something new and exciting.
